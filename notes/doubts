I'm using Spring Security. What do I return when the /login endpoint is hit ? Do I return anything ?
Do I even have to hit the endpoint or let jsession handle it all ??
Should I make sessionManagement stateless ? because REST should be stateless.. (doubt(1))
-- why so many /logins in openapi ?
store jwt token in localStorage or cookies ?
